<span class="gesperrt">OF THE</span><br/>
<big style="font-size: 1.4em;">Authority of Parliament, <i>&amp;c.</i></big></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">Of</span> all the objects, which have
since the revolution, engaged the
attention of the legislature, the proper
method of adjusting our present quarrels
with the Americans is undoubtedly
the most important. For as the riches
and power of Britain depend chiefly
on trade, and that trade on her colonies;
it is evident that her very existence
as the first of commercial nations,
turns upon this hinge.</p>

<p>It cannot therefore be impertinent in
any one modestly to offer his sentiments
on this topick; that by the confrontation
of different opinions we may strike
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>out truth, as we do fire by the collision
of flints; and that, as much light
as possible may be afforded to our legislators
to guide them through so dark
and intricate a labyrinth.</p>

<p>This is the more necessary, as there
can be found no similar case in all the
records of history to serve as a precedent,
or clew, to direct their steps; and
all they can do is to grope their way
by their own industry, and to employ
their reason, as the only compass which
can steer their course aright to this land
unknown.</p>

<p>Without any farther preamble, therefore,
I shall proceed to discuss this
point, and to state the case fairly between
the two contending parties, that
those, who having like myself, no particular
interest concerned, have consequently
little prepossession for either
side, may be enabled to form an adequate
idea of the subject.</p>

<p>While the colonies were under any
apprehensions from the encroachments
of the French and Indians, they submitted
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>to the British legislature without
reluctance; because they were sensible
of their inability to defend themselves,
and of the necessity of taking
shelter under the wings of their mother.
But no sooner were the
French kites and Indian vultures scared
away, than they began to strut and
to claim an independent property to
the dunghil. Their fear and their
natural affection forsook them at one
and the same time. They now boast
that they owe their present happy state
to no power on earth but themselves;
that they worked out their own salvation
by their own right arm: forgetting
that, had we not conquered at
Louisbourg, at Quebec, and many
other places; had we not constantly
protected and defended them, the
French and Indians would have long
ago reduced them to the situation of
the ancient Britons, and we should ere
now have received some such letter as
this, inscribed, <i>The groans of the Americans.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>The barbarians, on one hand,
drive us into the sea; the sea on the
other, forces us back on the barbarians:
so that we have only the hard alternative
left us, of perishing by the sword, or
by the waves.</i></p>

<p>Their insolence is arrived to such a
pitch that they are not ashamed to assume
to themselves the merit of bringing
the last war but one to a period.
According to them, what obliged the
enemy to listen to terms of accommodation
was not our success by sea, not
the ruin of the French navy, not the
total stagnation of their trade, not the
march of the Russian auxiliaries; but
the reduction, in a couple of short
days, by a couple of little cannon, of
a little island hardly discernable in a
map, called Cape-Breton.</p>

<p>This undutiful, this disobedient behaviour
of Britain's children abroad,
owed, no doubt, its origin partly to the
causes assigned above, and partly to
the murmurs and discontent of those at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>home; the Sacheveril in London produced
another in Boston; the spirit of
disaffection and mutiny, which the harangues
of a general raised in the cyder
counties, those of a colonel conjured
up in New-England. Out of one
hydra many more arose, and there
wants a Hercules to crush them. But
who has the courage and skill to wield
his club? In hopes that such a hero
will arise, I will endeavour to furnish
him with weapons, and to show him
how to pierce the vitals of the monster.</p>

<p>The most effectual way, in my opinion,
of laying the spirit of disaffection
among the colonists, and of quieting
the present disturbances to the mutual
satisfaction of each party, is to convince
the Americans that they ought
to be taxed rather than the English,
and to prove that the interest of both
is best promoted by leaving the power
of taxation in the hands of the British
legislature; I shall therefore address
myself now to this task.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>
In this age all the kingdoms in Europe
maintain a standing military force,
which may be ready on all occasions
to defend themselves, and to seize every
opportunity of annoying their foes;
Great-Britain therefore is obliged to
keep, tho' contrary to the genius of
its constitution, a large body of regular
troops in constant pay: and as
America must have a considerable share
of these for its safeguard, on whom
ought the burden of supporting them
to fall, but on the Americans, to
whom they prove an immediate benefit?
Great-Britain is sufficiently exhausted
already; she has spilt plenty
of her blood in their cause, she has
expended many millions in their service,
and has by these means contracted
an immense load of debt, of which
she is never likely to be eased. Must
she then expire under her pressures?
Instead of being relieved, must a new
burden be laid on her shoulders to
crush her entirely? A tax for the support
of American guards and garrisons
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>must be raised somewhere; else all the
labour of the last war may be lost in a
moment; the colonies may be conquered
by our enemies in one campaign.</p>

<p>What then must be done? America
must be taxed. By no means,
says America; I am sufficiently taxed
already; the many restrictions and
prohibitions, under which I labour in
point of trade, are an ample tax. You
gain of me by way of balance about
half a million a year; let this be applied
to the defence of America, and
it will be found an abundant provision
for all her wants.</p>

<p>But why, good America, dost thou
not also desire us to apply to the defence
of Spain and Turkey all that we
gain by them annually? The argument
will hold equally good, and cannot
be absurd in the latter case without
being so in the former.</p>

<p>Why likewise, do'st thou not throw
into the opposite scale the many millions,
which we have already laid out
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>for thy preservation, and see whether
they do not make all, that we have
ever drawn from thee, mount up and
kick the beam.</p>

<p>Thou sayest indeed, that we receive
in the general course of trade all the
specie, which thou can'st spare; and
that it is cruel, nay, impolitick, to
exact more than thou can'st afford; as
excessive imposts always damp industry,
create a despondency in merchants,
and incapacitate a state for furnishing
its ordinary quota of taxes.</p>

<p>But let me tell thee that the money
raised by the stamp act, being all necessary
for paying the troops within
thy own territories, must center wholly
in thyself, and therefore cannot possibly
drain thee of thy bullion.</p>

<p>It is true, this act will hinder thee
from sucking out the blood of thy
mother, and gorging thyself with the
fruit of her labour. But at this thou
oughtest not to repine, as experience
assures us that the most certain method
of rendering a body politick, as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>well as natural, wholesome and long-lived,
is to preserve a due equilibrium
between its different members; not to
allow any part to rob another of its
nourishment, but, when there is any
danger, any probability of such a catastrophe,
to make an immediate revulsion,
for fear of an unnatural superfetation,
or of the absolute ruin and
destruction of the whole.</p>

<p>All countries, unaccustomed to
taxes, are at first violently prepossessed
against them, though the price, which
they give for their liberty: like an ox
untamed to the yoke, they show, at
first, a very stubborn neck, but by
degrees become docile, and yield a
willing obedience. Scotland was very
much averse to the tax on malt; but
she is so far from being ruined by it,
that it has only taught her to double
her industry, and to supply, by labour,
what she was obliged to give up
to the necessities of the state. Can
America be said to be poorer, to be
more scanty of money than Scotland?
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>No. What then follows? America
must be taxed.</p>

<p>It is in vain to pretend that the increase
of the American territories, and
of the commodities, which they furnish
to the British markets, has reduced
the price of any article; or placed the
ancient colonists in a worse situation
than before the war; and consequently
rendered them incapable of bearing
any additional burden.</p>

<p>Europe is still the same as in seventeen
hundred and fifty-five, its inhabitants
are as numerous; therefore as
Britons, with regard to it and America,
are, for the most part, but factors,
the demand for American goods
must be as great, if not greater, than
formerly; their value cannot be diminished,
nor can the Americans be
worse situated than at the commencement
of the war.</p>

<p>It is equally idle to pretend that a
tax on America must prove prejudicial
to Britain.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>
A tax for defending it must, as
hinted above, be levied somewhere;
either in Britain or its colonies: and
nothing is more manifest than that
those, on whom the tax is laid, or
who advance the money, must be the
only sufferers, as in all dealings between
two, what is taken from the
one is added to the other; it always requires
some time to balance accounts,
by raising the price of commodities in
proportion to the tax, and to reduce
every thing by the course of circulation
to a level. What America loses,
Britain gains; the expences of the
former are a saving to the latter. All
the world is sensible of the justness of
this maxim, the clamours of the colonists
are a striking proof of it. If
they were not convinced of this truth,
why grumble at the impost? If they
did not know that a tax upon them
must prove comparatively detrimental
to their country, and serviceable to
Britain, why exclaim against it?
How absurd then, is it to advance that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>as an argument for the abolition of the
tax, which was the principal one for
opposing it? Indeed, to alledge that
England will gain more by laying the
tax on herself, is to alledge that a
man, who gives his daughter an annual
pension, becomes richer than if
he received an equal sum.</p>

<p>I own, if Britain, by any channel,
receives in return a larger portion than
she bestows, she gains by the bargain.
But that cannot be the present case;
for by taxing herself she raises the
price of provisions, which encreases
that of labour, and manufactures, not
only at home, but also in America,
and all other foreign markets; by
which means all her rivals in trade
undersell her; she diminishes the quantity
of her exports, the number of her
artisans and people, and empoverishes
herself in general. Whereas by levying
the tax on the colonies, she saves
a round sum of money annually; the
price of her manufactures continues
nearly the same, and as the wants of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>the colonists, cannot be much lessened,
her exports are almost equally
considerable; in short, the foregoing
prospect is wholly inverted.</p>

<p>But why keep any Forces at all in
America? She is sufficiently able to
defend herself.  Every Male above
sixteen years of age is enrolled in the
militia; they have arms, they are
disciplined, their numbers are great,
and still upon the Increase: what
more is wanting for her security? Is
she in greater danger now, that the
French are exterminated, than she
was before the last war, when the
enemy pressed vigorously upon her,
and yet hardly any troops were to be
found throughout her whole extent?</p>

<p>No; but lest the same Difficulties
should recur, lest the same quarrels
which bred the last expensive and
bloody War, should return, troops
must be maintained for her safeguard.
Britain observes this policy within herself;
is it not absurd to imagine she
would not follow the same maxim
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>with regard to her colonies? She
keeps on foot a considerable body of
forces to be prepared on every emergency,
not only to oppose a public
foe, but also to enforce the decisions
of the civil magistrate. And notwithstanding
the antipathy which most
people have to standing armies, they
have been found to be very useful;
and no government, antient or modern,
can be named, which was not,
without their assistance, subject to
bloody riots and insurrections. Nor
is there any danger to be apprehended
from them, while their number is
small, while the sword is in the hands
of the people in general, while, as in
America, there is a superior well regulated
militia to check them, if
they should discover any sinister design
against liberty.</p>

<p>It is with a view of being useful to
the mother country, that colonies are
first planted; this is part of their
charter, a tacit condition, on which
they are allowed to depart and settle;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>therefore they are not allowed by the
laws of nature and nations to violate
this agreement, as long as the mother
is able to avail herself of it, and treats
them with due Lenity and maternal
affection. A few restrictions
on their trade, in order to pay off
what debts they contracted, while
yet in the nursery, cannot be construed
into acts of severity, and as
little can a tax intended for their own
defence, and appropriated to that sole
use.</p>

<p>Upon the supposition that America
is never to be taxed, this country,
which now groans, and is like long
to groan under the weight of taxes,
will in time be left desolate, all its
inhabitants will flock to America, to
enjoy the benefits of a less oppressive
government, and to mingle with a
people of similar manners, religion
and laws. Britain, the assylum of
liberty, the seat of arts and sciences,
the glory of Europe, and the envy
of the world, will be ruined by her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>own ungrateful sons, and become a
desart. What neither Spain nor
France, nor all the world combined,
could accomplish, America, the child
of her own fostering, will effect.</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="stanza">
Quos neque Tydides, nec Larissæus Achilles,<br/>

Vincentur <em>pueris</em>.
</div>
</div>

<p>America will prove a continual
drain upon her industry and people,
an eternal spunge to suck up her vital
moisture, and leave her a dry and sapless
trunk, exposed, without branches,
without leaves, to the inclemency of
the weather. This event may be distant,
but it is in the womb of time;
and must be brought forth, unless we
have sufficient skill to cause an abortion.</p>

<p>But what does America gain by all
this? A transitory independence perhaps,
on the most noble constitution,
which the wit of man has been hitherto
able to invent. I say transitory
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>independence, for the broken and disjointed
members of the American empire
cannot be cemented and consolidated
into one firm mass; it is too
unwieldy and unmanageable; it is
composed of particles too heterogeneous
to be ever melted down into one
consistent and well digested system of
liberty. Anarchy and confusion will
soon prevail, were it to attempt an
union; and the loss of liberty will
tread fast upon their heels. For a free
and extended empire on a continent
are incompatible: to think they are not
is a perfect solecism in politicks. No
history furnishes us with an example;
foreign conquest, or the power with
which the magistrate must be entrusted,
are an invincible obstacle in their
way. It is in islands alone, where
one part of the people cannot be so
easily employed to oppress the other,
where the sea separates them from conquerors
and great empires, that liberty
can be deemed a native of the soil.
What a wretched exchange, then,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>would the Americans make! They
would barter liberty for slavery.</p>

<p>But, say they, we are not represented
in parliament.</p>

<p>True; you are not; no more is
one twentieth of the British nation;
but they may, when they become
freeholders, or burgesses: so may you;
therefore complain not; for it is impossible
to render any human institution
absolutely perfect. Were the
English animated by your spirit, they
would overturn the constitution to-morrow.</p>

<p>Like the colonies of all other countries,
you enjoy the privilege of being
governed in the same manner, as the
people, from which you are derived.
You have the same parliament, the
same laws; you are all deemed free-born
Britons, and are intitled to all
their immunities. What would you
have more? Would you reduce your
protectors, your deliverers, your parents
to a state of servitude, by obliging
them to pay taxes for you? It is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>plain, too plain, excessive prosperity
has rendered your heads giddy, you
attempt to soar higher than your
strength will carry you, than your
safety will permit; it is incumbent
on us, under whose care you are, to
clip your wings.</p>

<p>You tell us you are very sober and
temperate, that you fear the influence
of a standing army will corrupt you,
and introduce profligacy and debauchery.</p>

<p>I take your word for it, and believe
you are as sober, temperate, upright,
humane and virtuous, as the
posterity of independents and anabaptists,
presbyterians and quakers, convicts
and felons, savages and negro-whippers,
can be; that you are as
loyal subjects, as obedient to the laws,
as zealous for the maintenance of order
and good government, as your
late actions evince you to be; and I
affirm that you have much need of
the gentlemen of the blade to polish
and refine your manners, to inspire
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>you with an honest frankness and openness
of behaviour, to rub off the rust
of puritanism, and to make you ashamed
of proposing in your assemblies,
as you have lately done, to pay
off no more debts due to your original
native country.</p>

<p>I am only afraid that you will not
be blest with enough of their company;
they will be obliged to live on
the frontiers, in order to check the
Indians, and to preserve your hairy
scalps untouched; they must be constantly
exposed to secret treachery, and
open violence, for your ease and security;
and yet you will not contribute
a single penny for their support.</p>

<p>In the name of wonder, what would
you desire? Every farthing raised by
the stamps, and a great deal more
from Britain, is necessary for your defence,
and is to be applied solely to
that purpose: what more would you
ask? Would you, preferably to all the
parts of the British dominions, be
exempted from taxes?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
Do you murmur because Britain is
not taxed for you, or because you are
not allowed to lay the tax on what
commodities you please? If the former
be the source of your discontent,
you are very unnatural, and very ungrateful:
very unnatural, because you
have no compassion, no fellow-feeling
for the distresses of your exhausted
parent; very ungrateful, because, after
Britain has done so much for you, after
she has nourished and reared you up,
from your sickly infancy to a vigorous
state of adolescence, or rather manhood,
after she has conquered your
enemies, and placed you, if now you
be not wanting to yourselves, beyond
the reach of French perfidy and fraud,
you will not stretch forth your hand
to ease her, sinking under her burden,
nor contribute to her security, or more
properly your own.</p>

<p>But if the latter gave rise to your
disaffection, you are very ill informed,
very short sighted, in not perceiving,
that a general tax, for the general defence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>of all America, could not be
raised by <em>peace-meal</em>, in every province
separately. How could the quota of
every colony be ascertained; and, if
it could be ascertained, how were the
colonists to be persuaded to grant it?
We remember with what difficulty
they were induced to advance money
for their own defence in the late war,
when the enemy was at their gates,
when they fought <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro aris &amp; focis</i>, for
their religion and property. Some of
them have not, to this day, contributed
a single shilling. Are we to
imagine, that they will be more forward,
more lavish now, when the danger
is distant, and perhaps imperceptible
to the dull senses of most of
them, than when it stared them in the
face, and threatened immediate ruin.
Whoever thinks so, must be a very
weak politician, and ought to be sent
to catch flies with Domitian.</p>

<p>Each assembly among you, forsooth,
pretends to an equality with the
British parliament, and allows no laws
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>binding but those, which are imposed
by itself. But mark the consequence.
Every colony becomes at once an independant
kingdom, and the sovereign
may become, in a short time,
absolute master, by playing the one
against the other.</p>

<p>But were the sovereign always virtuous
enough not to avail himself of
this power, which with the greatest
good nature, with the utmost political
foresight, you thus put into his hand,
quarrels would, in all probability, soon
arise among you. It is well known
you cannot boast of much mutual
love, or christian charity; the same
spirit which actuated your ancestors,
and kindled the flames of civil war in
this country, still reigns among you,
and wants but a single spark to raise a
combustion.</p>

<p>You will tell me, perhaps, that
notwithstanding the multiplicity of
governments, you may, like the Swiss
cantons, live for ages in harmony and
unity.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
But I aver the contrary. The
strength of the Protestants and Roman
Catholicks among them, is nearly
equal, and keeps them in awe of
each other; but above all, the fear of
being crushed by the surrounding
powers in case of intestine dissensions,
prevents ambitious projects, and secures
the peace. But as neither of
these is your case, you have little reason
to hope that you could preserve
your liberties. Greece, as soon as it
ceased to dread the Persian monarch,
fell immediately into the hands of a
despotick prince; you have no king
of Persia to fear, how then do you
expect to remain free from slavery?
Believe me, your safest course is to
continue in your dependence on Britain,
where liberty is naturalized,
and where you are entitled to every
blessing with which it is attended.</p>

<p>Can you be so weak as to imagine
that the two houses of parliament will
allow you to set up a claim to uncontrollable
authority in your several provinces?
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>Perhaps you do not comprehend
how this will in time reduce them,
and consequently you to mere cyphers?
I will inform you. The power
of the crown is, of late, greatly encreased,
by the vast number of places,
which the last war, and the enormous
growth of the national debt have left
at its disposal. Give it also but the
management of the colonies, exclusive
of the parliament, and there needs no
more, in a few years, to render it despotick.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the weight of this
consideration was what moved the
British, to assume a superiority over the
Irish parliament; and Ireland, considerable
a country as it is, submits to
their controul; how can you have the
front to ask greater privileges? Indeed,
till you are placed on a quite
different footing, you cannot expect
even this indulgence: such a number
of scattered jarring governments would
create so much embarrassment and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>perplexity, as to be quite unmanageable.</p>

<p>Some of you <ins title="comlpain">complain</ins> that the
privileges granted by your charters are
invaded.</p>

<p>But by whom, pray, were these
privileges granted? By a king,
who had no power, I mean legal
power, to grant you any privileges,
which rendered you independent of
parliament, no more than he can
make a corporation in England independent
of it. Talk not then, of
such privileges; the spirit of the British
constitution could allow you none, by
which you did not remain subordinate
to every branch of the legislature, and
consequently subordinate to parliament.
The king makes but one member
of the legislature, and it is self-evident
he cannot give away the rights
and privileges of the rest. He can
grant any body of men a charter, by
which they are empowered to make
bye-laws for their own government,
but farther his prerogative does not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>extend. He cannot free them from
obedience to acts of parliaments.</p>

<p>Another, and a general complaint
is, that you are taxed by a body of
men unacquainted with your circumstances.</p>

<p>But who can be so well acquainted
with the circumstances of the colonies
in general, as the British parliament?
It is composed of men very well versed
in mercantile affairs, and much accustomed
to the discussion of intricate
questions; many of them are merchants,
and merchants that trade to
America and the West Indies. They
are always ready to receive information
from any hand, and never proceed to
business of importance, till they have
made the requisite inquiries. Nothing
can be a better proof of this, than
their conduct with regard to the stamp
act. A year before it was passed, the
ministers desired you to send agents
over to London, in order to propose
your objections to the whole, or any
part of it; but you neglected this reasonable
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>request; therefore, if the duty
on some articles should be too high,
you have none but yourselves to blame.</p>

<p>How then can you pretend to set
up your own knowledge in competition
with that of the British parliament?
Every single assembly among
you, may, perhaps, be a better judge
of its own province than it; but that
is all: a full and comprehensive idea
of the whole they cannot be expected
to have; their own particular interest
they may understand, but the interest
of the colonies in general is an object
too large, too complex, to be taken
in at one view, and to be perfectly
scanned by them. It is the British
legislature alone, whose close connection
with all the colonies, whose thorough
acquaintance with their trade
and with commerce in general, is
universally allowed, that is properly
qualified for such an arduous task.</p>

<p>Thus have I shewn that the interest
of both parties, of England and America,
is best promoted by adhering
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>religiously to the ancient system; that
a claim of new privileges by the Americans,
for they have been taxed before
by our parliament, will be attended
with many immediate disadvantages,
and that the remote consequence will
be their own ruin and slavery.</p>

<p>But if, after all, the prejudices of
the Americans should be so great as
to make them reject all reasonable
terms of accommodation, should they
be so tenacious of what they call their
privileges, as to be fully resolved on
asserting an absolute independence on
the parliament of Great Britain. Should
they be determined, rather than yield
to it as formerly, to proceed to the
last extremity, I would, with all due
deference to the wisdom of parliament,
advise a certain number of contiguous
provinces to be incorporated, and to
be allowed parliaments under the same
restriction as that of Ireland.</p>

<p>If they decline this equitable compromise,
were I a member of either
House, I would give my vote for treating
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>them as the Romans did the Latins,
when they attempted by force to make
themselves denizens of Rome. This
step, I own, is dangerous, and very
delicate in its management, but in such
a crisis, it is the only one which can,
with any dignity and prudence, be
taken.</p>

<p>Though the partizans of America,
in order to throw dust in our eyes, and
erect a bug-bear to the ignorant, insinuate
that the colonies would, in this
extremity, follow the example of the
Low Countries under Philip the Second,
and call in the assistance of France
and Spain. There is little reason to be
apprehensive on that score; for the
case is by no means parrellel: the
Flemings and Dutch contended for
ancient established rights, which had
been allowed such by their oppressors
themselves; the Americans assert privileges
unknown, unheard of before;
the Spaniards were strangers and foreigners
to the inhabitants of the Low
Countries; the Britons are brothers and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>relations to the Americans; the seventeen
provinces were cruelly oppressed
by the king of Spain, and a few of
his counsellors; the colonies are moderately
taxed by the whole body of
the British legislature. Is it credible
then, that, in order to free themselves
from the gentle tutorage of their parent,
they should run directly into the
jaws of ruin and slavery? It is more
probable that, when they hear of the
final determination of this point against
them by our parliament, the weight
and authority of that body, the most
august in the world, will make them
sit down, like the Cyder counties,
quiet under their burden.</p>

<p>But should they be so far infatuated
as to act otherwise, it is in our power
to prevent any fatal consequence; the
British fleet can soon bring them to
reason; all their capital towns lie defenceless
on the edge of the shore, and
must always obey the dictates of the
tremendous mouths of cannon. This,
however, is the last argument which
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>ought to be used; for it is always of
consequence to preserve the affections
of subjects, to rule them by love rather
than fear: nothing but the utmost
contumacy, of which, I trust in
Heaven, they will never be guilty,
can justify such a violent measure.</p>

SPEECHES and DEBATES in the
<span class="smcap">British House of Commons</span> from the Year
1742, to the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in
1748. In the Debates of this Period, are many
important Motions arising from a Variety of
interesting Events, both Domestic and Foreign.
Several material Changes in the Administration,
were the Consequence of those Debates.
As the Attention of Parliament was occasionally
employed upon a long and expensive War
with both France and Spain, and the Suppression
of an unnatural and intestine Rebellion;
a Moment's Reflection will shew this to have
been one of the most important Periods in our
History. It is therefore to be regretted, that
these Debates have not been collated and digested
before, and that so necessary a Work
has been so long neglected; a Work so essentially
useful to every Member of Parliament,
and every Lover of Constitutional History.
These Debates which are principally compiled
from authentic Notes taken in the House,
are arranged partly upon the same Plan with
Chandler's Collection, which is brought down
to the Year 1742; but with such Improvements
from the Journals, and other authentic
Papers, as, it is presumed, will render them
worthy the Notice of every British Legislator.</p>
